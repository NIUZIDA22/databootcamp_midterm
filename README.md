# databootcamp_midterm
Midterm project for databootcamp. 

Data Source: Last.fm API
Project Overview
This project explores listening trends across countries and genres using the Last.fm API. It examines country-level differences in artist and track popularity, while also identifying music genre trends, alongside artist recommendations. We use API requests, data cleaning, and data visualization to highlight local music preferences as well as universal musical patterns.

Driving Questions
How do popular artists and tracks differ across countries, and what does this reveal about cultural listening preferences?

Which genres and tags dominate global music scenes, and how do they overlap or remain distinct?

Can frequency-based recommendations reveal clusters of artists with similar audiences across genres?

How consistent are popular tags across genres, and what does this imply about evolving genre boundaries?
